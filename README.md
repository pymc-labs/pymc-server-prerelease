# Quickstart

## Installation

Install this library from PiPy `pip3 install pymc-server`

### Setting up a cloud: Google Cloud

1. Run `pymcs check` to see if you already have credentials setup. If you see a green checkmark for GCP (Google Cloud Platform), skip to the next section
2. Install the google cloud SDK and authenticate.
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge google-cloud-sdk
  gcloud init

  # Run this if you don't have a credentials file.
  # This will generate ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json.
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
  > Tip:
  > If you are using multiple GCP projects, list all the projects by gcloud projects list and activate one by gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID> (see GCP docs).

3. Follow the link to Google and authorize the Google Cloud SDK. This will create and persist credentials on your local computer. Running pymc-server commands via Google Cloud will introduce cost to your Google Cloud bill according to the VMs provisioned by your configuration (see next section).

  Follow through the rest of the GCP configuration in your terminal.

  > Tip:
  > You can see a global status of active VMs by running `pymcs status`



### Status of your deployments

Running `pymcs status` all your deployments are checked and displayed in a table.

```bash
